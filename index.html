<h1>Hi Everyone, Welcome to Nikolas's Portfolio</h1>
<p>Welcome Everyone to My Portfolio, I am new to coding but so far I love it and will be updating my portfolio on a regular basis as I go along and learn more and more. I am always open to learning new things so if anyone ever feels like reaching out and
    touching base, please do so.</p>
<p> Just a little about me, I was born in Caracas, Venezuela but I grew up in San Diego. As a senior in Highschool I moved to Italy and spent the next three years between Florence and London. I also speak three languages fluently, English, Spanish and Italian,
    and soon, Javascript</p> 😂<img src="Nala&me.jpg" alt="Me " class="responsive">
